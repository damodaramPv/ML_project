## Description:
For the people who cannot or have a low level of speaking and hearing, the best and the most
efficient way to communicate or to convey information is through Sign language. Sign language
consists of particular hand gestures that are related directly to a known alphabet, number or
expressing feeling and emotions. This mode of communication has allowed individuals with
hearing impairments to clearly express their opinions and emotion and also serves as a means to
bridge the gap between the hearing-impaired and those with typical hearing abilities.

One of the methods that are used to translate or interpret the sign language is by classifying
the images based on the hand gestures. In order to recognise the various hand gestures, several
methods have been developed to translate and recognise the sign language through image classification of various images.This classification can be efficiently developed by a convolutional neural
network (CNN) architecture based on the deep learning technique.In the proposed project, a
dataset of images having a multi class and correctly labeled images are trained through the architecture. This hand gesture data image is converted to text using CNN (Convolutional Neural
Networks) based deep learning.

The primary motivation of this project is to develop a model that helps to accurately translate such messages
in sign language alphabets into English language alphabets. This model is just a staring point
of this large problem where we want to achieve translation of static sign language images into
English alphabets.
